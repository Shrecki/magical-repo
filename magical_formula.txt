I went to see the wizard
In the middle of the night.
His eyes were fierce and far away,
His cloak was burning bright.

"O wizard, can you teach me
How to rise and fly away?"
He stared at me, and glared at me,
And taught me what to say:

"Swiggity swooty, I'm going to fly oopsie!"

I said it once, I said it twice,
I said it three times three,
With mighty shout I bawled it out,
Until he growled at me
